# Outlier detection from raw text

This is a repository for a homework assignment in the Machine Learning 2 course during my [Master in NLP](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/master/master-language-analysis-processing). It aims to process raw text, detect outliers and see how different ways of handling them affects the quality of binary sentiment analysis.
